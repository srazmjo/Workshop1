4. Ngounié (Mouila)

### Healthsites Accros Gabon
Most of Gabon's health facilities are public, but there are some private institutions as well. Gabon's medical infrastructure is considered one of the best in West Africa. As of 2004, there are 29 physicians per 100,000 people, with nearly 90% of people having access to health care services. Since the western provinces of Gabon is heavily populated due to proximity of water, major public health facilities are also located in there. The red dots on the map shown show the main health facilities through Gabon. The eastern part of Gabon, heavily populated by the lower and middle income families has limited access to an ideal health care services.

Nyanga is the least populated province of the nine and the other least developed despite being the southern coast of Gabon with sea ports and trade routes.
