Perspective Question: In the Lloyd et al. article, the authors introduce a method that uses a number of different openly available 
geospatial datasets in order to produce high resolution, global gridded descriptions of human populations. Describe the geospatial 
datasets the authors are using in their methodology. How is their method an improvement when compared to a conventional census? 
Are you able to describe how the authors use a number of different geospatial layers with their data science method in order to produce 
a high resolution, global gridded description of human population?

Answer: 
Per their descriptions, the detailed and contemporary spatial datasets that they use for production of high resolution descriptions of 
human populations can accurately describe human population distribution and analyze the impacts of population growth, 
 monitoring changes, environmental and health applications, and the planning of interventions. It is a crucial advantage that their 
 spatial datasets enables data scientists to precisely model patterns of epidemic, disease, accessibility issues, disaster management,
 poverty mapping, and environmental problems facing a specific area. Compared to conventional census data, these data sets can 
 significantly improve the national scale gridded population data. From the other hand, the disaggregation of the data sets and breaking up
 a large data into multiple different constituents parts can enhance the precision of the data. This solution also enables scientists 
 to process data at a high scale -meaning that they can visualize and analyze data at a much higher resolution, for example 100m x 100m as the text mentions. 
 Rasters images consist of a grid of pixels of particular size with each apportionment of the pixel having a different x and y coordinate value. Rasters are used in GIS applications where they represent elevation models of earth's surface. 
 Data scientists also use areal-weighting method which includes uniform distribution and proportional allocation to disaggregate population
 from census units into grid cells in order to create an exclusive function of the land area which details the area's population count 
 and density.
