Perspective Question: In the Lloyd et al. article, the authors introduce a method that uses a number of different openly available 
geospatial datasets in order to produce high resolution, global gridded descriptions of human populations. Describe the geospatial 
datasets the authors are using in their methodology. How is their method an improvement when compared to a conventional census? 
Are you able to describe how the authors use a number of different geospatial layers with their data science method in order to produce 
a high resolution, global gridded description of human population?

Answer: 
Per their descriptions, the detailed and contemporary spatial datasets that they use for production of high resolution descriptions of 
human populations can accurately describe human population distribution and analyze the impacts of population growth, 
 monitoring changes, environmental and health applications, and the planning of interventions. It is a crucial advantage that their 
 spatial datasets enables data scientists to precisely model patterns of epidemic, disease, accessibility issues, disaster management,
 poverty mapping, and environmental problems facing a specific area. Compared to conventional census data, these data sets can 
 significantly improve the national scale gridded population data. From the other hand, the disaggregation of the data sets and breaking up
 a large data into multiple different constituents can enhance the precision
