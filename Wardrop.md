# Response to Wardrop's Article

By Sayyed Hadi Razmjo on February 17th


In the reading for today, the authors (Wardrop et al.) introduce a top-down approach as well as a bottom-up approach. Describe each of these two methods. Compare and contrast them with one another. What advantages do these new methodologies present when compared to past approaches? Are you able to provide an example of each (bonus)?

In this article, the authors assert that the past approaches for measuring national population and housing
data can be outdated, inaccurate, or missing key groups and societies. They also discuss how new 
technologies are now enabling robust and cost-effective solutions. Two new approaches offered in this
article to limit the inefficiency of population and housing census are "Top-down" and "Bottom-up" 
methods. 


The top-down techniques draw on ancillary or “covariate” data to redistributedata at finer scales 
by defining a functional relationship between, in this case, population density and the mapped ancillary
data. After the rapid advancement in technologies in the mid 1990s, data scientists and researchers
have used Geographic information systems and satellite remote-sensing techs for dasymetric mapping
of population which enables them to produce high spatial-resolution grids to represent ancillary 
data as well as the population distributions across a specific area. An early example of top-down 
census disaggreation products is the proportional allocation of population counts to grid cells within
each administrative area and smoothing across boundaries. Other examples include allocation of 
population based on covariates known to correlate with population density. However, over the past 
few decades, there has been significant changes in data avaibality, the computational power of the 
computers computing the data, and new methodologies. Despite all the advantages, there are some drawbacks
to this method as well. The central challenge to the accuracy of top-down disaggregation method is the 
reliability of input population data. Since this method is resource-intensive and requires modern
technologies, especially in low-income countries, this method might now work well as desired given the 
frequent changes in government, insecurity, mass migrations and ...


The other method, called the "bottom-up", despite sharing a common goal of producing population
estimates for small areas, uses a different approach. Conceptually, bottom-up estimation of population 
relies on complete counts of population within small, defined areas, and collected relatively rapidly 
and at a fraction of the cost of a full national census. Statistical models are then used tolink 
microcensus data to spatial covariate data, with full coverage over the regions of interest to predict 
population numbers in unsampled locations. An example of bottom-up style, is spatially disaggregated 
population estimation focusing mainly on urban settings, with the are of cities being used to estimate
population sizes. The bottom-up estimation entails (i) microcensus population enumeration;
(ii) linkage with relevant ancillary datasets; and (iii) definition of the functional relationships 
between ancillary datasets and the population data to predict populations in unsurveyed locations. 
A limitation to this approach is related to the use and broader impacts of population-mapping 
activities. making claims about a population total even using a national census is a highly political and contentious issue. The results affect all per capita rate estimates, shift political representation, and change claims to power or resources.
